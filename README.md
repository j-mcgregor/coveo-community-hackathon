# Coveo Community Hackathon

A Hackthon-produced MVP to demonstrate how Coveo and its employees can reach out to friends and family of colleagues worst affected by the devastating Covid 19 outbreak.

The idea is for an employee to create a page on behalf of a friend or family member, demonstrating their current and desired skills and goals, so that other members can either donate some money out their paycheck to their cause or volunteer their time as a coach
